Defining security
Security Studies
The study of security in the global context is a sub-discipline of the wider subject
usually still referred to as lnternatir;mal Relations. International Relations is the
study of all political interactions. betWeen international 'actors', which include:
states (represented by governments), international organizations (either intergovernmental or non-governmentaJl) and, to a lesser extent, some wealthy, private
individuals. Security Studies concerns itself with a sub-set of those political
interactions marked by their particular importance in terms of maintaining the
security of the actors and people. Where the line demarking International Relations'
sub-discipline is to be drawn is increasingly contentious, as indeed is the
demarcation of International Relations in r elation to the wider realm of Political
Science. Increased political interaction between actors, other than through the
traditionafSfate::to.:stater oute,-l:lasserved to blur the distinction between domestic
and foreign policy and widened the scope of International Relations. The ~ss
commonly referred t o as globalization has led to internal political issues becoming
increasingly externalized- and -e7t'ernal political issues increasingly internalized.
Traditionally domestic policy concerns, like health and rights, are mor e prominent
than ever on the global political agenda and events occurring in other states, such
as disasters or massacres, are more often than ever deemed to be of political
significance for people not personally affected. In light of these changes, and the
reduced prevalence of inter-state war, it has become a matter of contention amongst
theorists of International Relations whether Security Studies should maintain its
traditional emphasis on military threats to the security of states or widen its focus.
Alternative perspectives have argued increasingly that the discipline should either:
(1) extend its reach to include non-military threats to states and, perhaps, other
actors; or (2) go further and bring within its remit the security of all actors in r elation
to a range of threats, both military and non-military.
Realism
The main paradigms of International Relations offer alternative conceptual
frameworks for comprehending the complexity that emerges from attempting
to study the huge volume of interactions between actors that makes up the
contemporary global system. These different 'lenses' for making sense of this
political complexity focus in very different ways when it comes to thinking about
issues of security in International Relations.
Realists are the traditionalists in International Relations and Security Studies and
still the dominant paradigm, both academically and in terms of the 'real world' as --- ~~ -- ~

SECURI TY AND SEC URIT IZATI O N
the approach favoured by ,.g-oy~rnm nts in conducting their foreign policies. Classical
Realism emerged in e~ and dominated the young discipline of International
Relations with a straightforward and almost unchallenged view of how and why
politics on the world stage was conducted. The 'actors' were states. Intergovernmental organizatioru> (IGOs) were merely alliances of convenience between states
whilst international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) were considered
irrelevant (and indeed, by comparison with today, were so at the time). Hence the
world, in political terms, was a [state syst~_!Y. The in erac~ns between the states
in the system could be characterized as 'power politics'. A pessimistic view of human
nature permeates Realisrii.illeaning. tha(oril:he- world stage, it is assumed that
states should_not trust other states and therefore seek to 'look after _g11mber. one'
by extending their own power wherever possible in order to secure themselves.
This promotion of the self-in~of states is captured in the term 'national
inter est' (see Box 1.1). For Realists, governments making a clear distinction between
'high' and 'low' politics in their policy-making best serve the national interest.
Individual concerns with health, welfare and other 'low politics' issues are the stuff
of domestic politics and need to be kept separate from the 'high politics' of state
security. This approach was justified on the premise that failing to deter or losing
a_war would undermine the satisfaction of low politics aspirations. Individual
interests were inextricably tied up in the national intereStHence fo the UK in the
late 1940s society tolerated food rationing whilst the government poured the
country's shrunken exchequer into developing atomic weapons. Indivic;lual..bardship
was considered a price worth paying to aveyt the p9ti;;11follly catastrophic hardship
of failing to deter .invasion from the Soviet-Union ..
TI1e conundrum that emerges from assuming that a state's security is acJ1ieved
by its pursuing the maximization of its own power is that all states cannot
simultaneous!Y_follow this prescription. The security of one's own slate is likely to -
be enhanced at tJ1e Se of another state in what has· been termed th securzty
dilernma--:FOr Realists the security dilemma is averted by their faith in the balance
of /1•:-;r he balance of power keeps a sense of order to the 'anarchy' of the state
system as there is a mutual interest for the most powerful amongst them to work
toget :.~..sLixes e-s.tat1J.S... qti . The security of the mosfpowerf111Si:a1eS
rests on not allowing any one of them tipping the balance by becoming too powerful.
For classical Realists, then, Security Studies was pretty much synonymous with
International Relations.
The rise in significance of economic interactions between states in the 1960s
and 1970s broac~onal Relations beyond military power
politics to incor orate economic power issues. Realist thought metamorphosized
into 'Neo-Realism', which maintaine he focus on states and the pursuit of power
but acr€pte<ft11arnot everything that happens m the w&IOTs determined by milita1y
might. States could become powerful by concentrating on their economies (such
as West Germany and Japan), being lucky enough to possess a key economic
r esource (such as the oil-producing states) or by exe1·ting diplomatic influence in
the world without the resort to arms or threat of armed action. In light of this
a new sub-discipline of International Relations emerged considering such matters,
International Political EconomXJ!5.). For (Neo-) Realists then, Security Studies
became the military arm of International B~l tions and IPE its economic sister. 

Pluralism emerged as a paradigm of International Relations from th ~, made
up of scholars unconvinced that Neo-Realism had evolved far ~;6( lism to take account of the changes that had occurred in the world since the 1940s. It
began to be argued that adding the pursuit of economic power lo the pursuit of
military power by states was still too simplistic an understanding of..worlcl politics.
Pluralists, as the term implies, consider that a plurality of actors, rather than just
states, exert influence on the world stage. State domi~a ~--;; int rnati onal relations
was being eroded from above and below, the Pluralists contended. IGOs (such as
the European Community and organizations of the United Nations) had become

SEC U RITY A N D SEC UR IT I ZATI O N
more than expedient alliances and come to mould state policies together into
common interests which sometimes redefined or contradicted 'national' interests.
INGOs, such as pressure groups and multi-national corporations (MNCs), were
becoming significant players on the world stage in their own right and were not
necessarily acting in accord with their 'home' government. In addition, Pluralists
built on the political philosophy of Liberalism to argue that the amorality of the
national interest was not an appropriate guide to foreign policy. Individual people
prosper from the mutual benefits inherent in cooperation and would find their
interests better served in a world in which states and their interests, as defined by
their governments, ceased to dictate their lives.
For Pluralists these developments were making the interactions of politics
in the world more complex and varied. 'Low' politics issues, such as environmental
change or economic development, were becoming international as well as domestic
political issues. International Relations could E-2 ong i.:_~surp. _ a!]. that happens in
the world was related to a military - or even an ~~ omic - balance o:f.lliillrer between
states. This aspect of international. affairs was important but not all-subsuming and
an issue-based approach was necessary. This approach accepts that many nonmilitary issues are legitimate concerns of International Relations and that they might
be contended over without reference to military power on an increasingly busy
world stage.
For Pluralists then, Security Studies was but a small sub-set of the broad
subject that is International Relations. --- ---
The Marxist paradigm of International Relations is related to but not synonymous
with Marxist political thought. Proponents of the Marxist paradigm of International
Relations are usually also ideological Marxists, but not necessarily so and, in political
practice, Marxist governments have usually pursued foreign policies broadly Realist
in character. for such Marxist, or Structuralist, thinkers the Neo-Realist and Pluralist
conversion to appreciating the importance of economic factors in the conduct of
politics in the world was both belated and insufficient. conor~}_; __ g~ cerns, rather
than military or issue-specific power, determine the fate of the world's peoples and
always have done. In this view globalization is nothing new; if ismerelythe latest - - phase of the world's 'haves' exploiting the 'have nots'. Imperialism is not a relic of
a bygone age but a persistent feature of a global system built on the capitalist logic
of ever-increasing profit. From a Marxist perspective inter-state competition is a
side show to the 'competition' between the wealthy peoples of the worRrTrriOst of
the Cleveloped wo"i:rCla!ld ·a small fraction of elites in the less-developed world) and
the poor, in which there is consistently only one winner.
Marxists thus see International Relations as largely synonymous with IPE.
Security Studies, as it has evolved, is ~erfluo s since human and global security
can only ever come through global, structural change. Military strategy serves
global economic interests rather than national security interests. Wars are fought
to preserve or maintain exploitative economic systems (i.e. over colonies or over
the economic mastery of the whole system, like the Cold War). In this view the
5

fates of individuals are determined not so much by their states but by the wider
global system and only world Socialist revolution could improve their prospects.
"Reflective theories" and Social Constructivism
In the 1990s dissatisfaction with the three main paradigms of International Relations
(IR), and their myriad offshoots and hybrid theories, produced a range of theoretical
challenges influenced by a new wave of postmodernist thinking on methodology
(how you study a subject). The 'scientific method' - seeking to understand the
behaviour of states by the objective testing of theories and concepts - came to be
questioned by a new breed of IR scholars. Critical Theorists, such as Booth and
Wyn Jones, questioned the premise that studying human behaviour can ever be
objective and scientific and that the study of IR inevitably reflected a Western bias
(Booth 1991; Wyn Jones 1999). In a similar vein feminist scholars, such as Tickner
and Enloe, came to argue that IR had an inherent male bias and that concepts
like sovereignty and power were in need of re-appraisal in order to achieve an
understanding of the political world based on all of its people (rickner 1992; Enloe
1990). From these 'reflective theories' a fourth paradigm of International Relations
known as Social Constructivism emergecf. Changes-in-the 'real world' of international relations --------- as well as in thinking on how to study it also stimulated the new
theories. The way in which the Cold War ended and the panning out of the 'New
World Or_der' which followed, prompted a number of scholars to challenge many
of the assumptions of the discipline across the paradigms. In particular, Social
Constructivism argued that understanding political events in the world necessitated
more introspection and Jess grangaostractTheorJZJ!Jg. I'neparadigm favours a more
sociologlc<ll approach and advocates a greater appreciation of the cultural dimension
of policy-making. It began to be argued that maybe the actors on the world stage
do not really follow any kind of rational script, be it written in the language of selfinterest, mutual interest or dictated by economic circumstance. Perhaps, at least
some of the time, foreign policy reflects parochial ideological or moral guidelines
rather than objective gains. By the 1990s Ruggie, a lifelong Pluralist, contended
that that paradigm and Neo-Realism had come to share so much common ground,
in assuming states to be rational gain-driven actors (only differing in how they
gain), that they should henceforth be considered as a single paradigm of 'neoutilitarianism' (Ruggie 1998: 1- 39).
The USSR's voluntaiy 'defeat' in the Cold War, when Gorbachev negotiated
a 'surrender' with the enemy for what he considered to be the good of his country,
appeared to defy the logic of Realism and the national interest.2 In the proceeding
years the reluctance of the newly reunified Germany to use its enhanced physique
to exert greater power in Europe, favouring instead throwing their weight behind
European integration, appeared to oITer greater evidence of a government acting
according to ideas rather than interests. Constructivists consider that the three
e~~ms all downplay the normative element of politics in atternPffilg
to build 'value-free' 'scientific' models to explain the actions of international actors.
Thinking purely about 'who1
1 gets what' in reference to particular actors ignores the
role that can be played by human agency. The 1989 anti-communist revolutions in

SEC UR IT Y A N D SECU RITIZ A TIO N
Eastern Europe had demonstrated that ideas and people power could overcome
the interests of states and mould events.
Whereas Pluralists and Marxists tended to focus on other aspects of
International Relations, leaving Security Studies to the Realists, Social Constructivists mounted the first concerted attack on the logic of Security Studies as it had
developed during the Cold War years. Ontological questions largely ignored
between 1940 and 1990 began to be asked. Who are being secured? Who are doing
the securing? What is it to be secure? 
  
  
 This book adopts a broad and deep interpretation of security encompassing a
varied range of perceived threats to humankind, which takes the subject area well
beyond the framework of traditional treatments of international security politics
which have tended to focus on militaiy threats emanating from other states. This
broader approach to conceptualizing global security gained ground in the 1990s
when the ending of the Cold War seemed, to many statesmen, academics and
members of the general public, to herald a new era of international politics. In this
'New World Order' the threat of global nuclear Armageddon had subsided allowing
previously marginalized issues to emerge from the shadow of superpower rivalry
and register on the international political agenda. Such an approach to the subject
was, however, articulated as far back as 1983 when Ullman defined a threat to
security as:
an action or sequence of events that (1) threatens drastically and over a
relatively brief span of time to degrade the quality of life for the inhabitants
of a state or (2) threatens significantly to narrow the range of policy choices
available to a government of a state, or to private, nongovernmental entities
(persons, groups, corporations) within the state.
(Ullman 1983: 133)
Such an expansive interpretation of security found many critics amongst Realists,
who were not shaken from their belief in maintaining a narrower focus on what
constitutes Security Studies by the ending of the Cold War. Walt has forcefully
argued this case: 'security studies may be defined as the study of the threat, use
and control of military force' (Walt 1991: 212). Walt and the traditionalists fear that
widening the definition of security risks rendering the concept redundant by making
it too all-encompassing and diluting the important task of analysing military threats
and inter-state conflict. Underlying this fear is the belief of many Realists that
military threats are actually more apparent in a post-Cold War world devoid of that
traditional guarantor o( state security, the military balance of power. This 'anti-New
World Order' thesis was epitomized by Mearsheimer's lament in 1990 that 'we will
soon miss' the Cold War (Mearsheimer 1990). Some traditionalists consider the
demise of the Cold War to signal a need for Security Studies to go 'back to basics'
rather than broaden its base, since international politics shorn of the nuclear
balance of power imposed by the two superpowers would find the need to rediscover

lost arts of multilateral diplomacy, conflict resolution, fighting limited wars and
conventional defence (Chapman 1992).
Although there is a case to be made that military threats in the twenty-first
century are as apparent as ever, and maybe even greater than during the Cold
War, wideners and deepeners of security contend that they are not the only threats
that face states, people and the world as a whole. Indeed, they never have been.
Throughout history people have been killed by things other than soldiers and
weapons, and states have been weakened or destroyed by things other than military
conflict. Ullman argued that the security implications for states of demographic
pressures and resource depletion needed to be taken on board alongside military
threats from other states (Ullman 1983). This logic was developed further in a
seminal article by Mathews towards the end of the Cold War which highlighted
the need for states to give proper concern to the newly apparent threats posed by
environmental problems such as ozone depletion and global warming (Mathews
1989). With the shadow of the Cold War lifted many other 'wideners' emerged in
Security Studies literature in the 1990s. Ayoob highlighted that internal rather than
external threats were the principal security concern of most less developed countries
(LDCs) (Ayoob 1997). Peterson and Sebenius made the same point with reference
to that most developed and powerful state, the USA, positing that a crisis in
education and a growing economic 'underclass' should be understood as security
threats (Peterson and Sebenius 1992). Lynn-Jones and Miller addressed the need
to give attention to a range of previously neglected internal and external threats
such as virulent nationalism and the social impact of migration (Lynn-Jones and
Miller 1995). Although viewed as unwelcome by traditionalists, such as Walt and
Mearsheimer, this widening of security did not undermine the Realist logic of
conventional Security Studies. The focus was still on the state system and seeing
relationships between states as governed by power. Widening was simply a case
of extending the range of factors which affect state power beyond the confi nes of
military and trade affairs.
An argument for a more profound widening o( security than tacking on some
non-military issues to the range of threats to states emerged th rough the 1990s in
a new approach that came to be characterized as the 'Copenhagen School', after
the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute. Buzan trailblazed this approach in the
early 1990s (Buzan 1991) but it crystallized later in the decade, when he teamed
up with Waever and de Wilde in producing tJ1e groundbreaking work, Security.
Threats and vulnerabilities can arise in many different areas, military and
non-military, but to count as security issues they have to meet striclly defined
criteria that distinguish them from the normal run of the merely political.
They have to be staged as existential threats to a referent object by a
securitizing actor who the reby generates endorsement of emergency
measures beyond rules that would otherwise bind.
(Buzan, Waever and de Wilde 1998: 5)
Hence the Copenhagen School went furth er than the 'wideners' in two ways. First,
they facilitated the consideration of non-military issues, even if they had no military
dimension, so long as they represented 'existential threats'. Second, the approach

SECUR ITY AND SECUR I TI ZA TI ON
also partially deepened the meaning of security by arguing that issues can be
considered matters of security even if they are not threatening states (see Table
1.2). A key influence on this was the largely unforseen revival in nationalism in
Europe being played out in the post-Cold War landscape of Eastern Europe,
particularly in Yugoslavia. The fact that conflict and the disintegration of a state
occurred not as a result of a state security dilemma but because of internal 'societal
security' dilemmas (competition between different nationalities within the state)
prompted an attempt to incorporate sub-state groups into security analysis.
The deepening of security
Going beyond the Copenhagen School in extending the domain of Security Studies
is the 'deepening' approach led by Pluralists, Reflective Theorists and Social
Constructivists. Deepeners embrace the concept of 'human security' and argue that
the chief referent object of security should not be the state or certain sub-state groups,
such as stateless nations, but the individual people of which these institutions/
groups are comprised. The Pluralist Falk, for example, considers that security ought
to be defined as: 'the negation of insecurity as it is specifically experienced by
individuals and groups in concrete situations' (Falk 1995: 147). This is a significant
leap from widening which, as Falk describes: 'still conceives of security largely
from the heights of elite assessment, at best allowing the select advisor to deliver
a more enlightened message to the ear of the prince' (Falk 1995: 146). Ken Booth,
a self-styled '(alien Realist' led this challenge arguing in contradiction to the
assumptions he once shared that: 'Security and emancipation are in fact two sides
of the same coin. It is emancipation, not power and order, in both theo1y and
practice, that leads to stable security' (Booth 1991: 539).
The root of the problem with the traditional approaches to security politics
is what Wyn Jones, like Booth a Critical Theorist, describes as the '(etishization of
the state' (Wyn Jones 1999: eh. 4). This tendency in International Helations is not
resolved by the Copenhagen School approach. The Copenhagen School approach
accepts the idea that non-military issues can be securitized and that l11e referent
object of th is can be something other than a state but maintains the logic that only
the state can be the securitizing actor (i.e. decide whether the issue is acted upon
as a matter of urgency). Hence statecentricism is maintained, if in a subtler form.
The practical limitation with this is that not only are the traditional security agents
of the state (i.e. the army, externally, and police, internally) often inadequate for
dealing with security problems affecting the people of tJ1at state, they are often a
chief cause of those problems. Buzan accepts that states can be the source of threats
rather than protection for individual people but considers that this is a property of
only certain types of states. 'Strong states' coexisting in 'mature anarchy', which
have increasingly become the norm through democratization and ilie development
of international hwmm rig hl !'> w, c.an be relied upon to secure individuals (Buzan
1991: 98- 111). Hence Buzan and Waever are Neo-Realist wideners, albeit oJa much
more refined form than those who had preceded them.
Whilst the practical concern that widening the focus of Security Studies
should not distract attention from military threats has some validity, the intellectual
9
SECURITY AN D SECURITI ZATION

rationale for maintaining a narrower focus is weak. In a book taking a wider
approach to security (though not as wide as the Copenhagen School), Wirtz
contends that: 'if the threat of force, the use of force or even the logistical or technical
assistance that can be supplied by military units does little to respond to a given
problem, it probably is best not to treat the specific issue as a security threat' (Wirtz
2002: 312). He also scoffs at the idea that global warming should be construed as
a security issue stating: 'It is not exactly clear .... how military forces can help
reduce the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere' (Wirtz 2002: 311).
This view gives an indication of how blinkered the mainstream study of security
can be. Defining an issue as one of security on the basis of whether or not it involves
military forces strips the term of any real meaning. Security is a human condition.
To define it purely in terms of state bodies whose aim it is to help secure their
state and people in a certain dimension, rather than the people whose security is
at stake, is both odd and nonsensical. This way of framing what is and what is not
a security issue is akin to saying that children being taught to read by their parents
are not being educated or that happiness does not exist unless it is induced by the
performances of state-sponsored clowns. A security issue, surely, is an issue which
threatens (or appears to threaten) one's security. Defining a security issue in
behavioural terms rather than excluding certain categories of threats because they
do not fit conventional notions of what defines the subject area gives the term some
objective meaning. If people, be they government ministers or private individuals,
perceive an issue to threaten their lives in some way and respond politically to this
then that issue should be deemed to be a security issue.
It should be noted, though, that human security itself is a contested concept
with more and less expansive versions having come to be employed in both
academic and political discourse. Wider human security is often characterized as
combining 'freedom from want' and 'freedom from fear' (from tl1e UNDP description
of the concept) in that it considers any issues with direct or indirect life-threatening
consequences for individuals to be matters of security. Concerns among some
advocates of an individual-focused approach to security that 'existing de finitions of
human security lend to be extraordinarily expansive and vague' (Paris 2001: 88)
led them to favour a more restricted version based purely on 'freedom from fear'.
This narrow version of human security concentrates on direct and deliberate violent
threats, excluding less directly human-caused forms of insecurity like diseases
and disasters. The Canadian government have generally been supportive of such
an approach in their advocacy of human security as a pragmatic determinant of
when specific, concrete foreign policy actions - such as taking part in a humanitarian
intervention or developing international human rights conventions - should be
undertal<en. In contrast, the Japanese government's endorsement of human security
has tended to be more in line with the expansive version as favoured by the UNDP
and employed in this volume. There is a fatal fatalism in assuming that only direct
and deliberate threats to life can be deemed worthy of security status. Such a
restriction might make the concept easier to deal wit h hut does so by simply
choosing to ignore the insecurities of most of the world's people even when the
means of securing them are apparent.
Hence, by adopting the wide human security framework, the notion of security
is recast as a social construct stripping away the need for the analyst to speculate

SECUR IT Y AND SECUR IT IZAT ION
on what they think is the most threatening of the myriad issues on the contemporary
international political agenda and concentrate instead on analysing how and why
certain issues actually are perceived of as vital and responded to in an extraordinary
way by decision-makers. This approach is appropriate since it is demonstrable,
through opinion polls, that people do think of their security in different terms today
than they did during the Cold War (see Table 1.1). It is also observable in various
ways that the international political agenda has become far more diverse since 1990
with governments giving greater priority to issues such as environmental change,
drugs and public health. Even explicitly military organizations, like NATO, are
increasingly focusing on non-military activities such as disaster relief

vThe preoccupation of Security Studies with the state is very much a relic of the
Cold War. In some ways this is understandable since the discipline of International
Relations, and its sub-discipline Security Studies, only emerged in the 1930s and
was thus very much forged in an era of unprecedented military threats. Realism
was in the ascendancy at tl1e close of the Second World War since the application
of force had proved its worth in curbing aggression and restoring order in Europe
and Asia. Pre-Second World War international cooperation, in the form of lhe
League of Nations, and 'softly softly' appeasement diplomacy vis-a-vis aggressors
comprehensively failed to keep the peace. In addition, the total war of the Second
World War and the 'total phoney war' ofthe Cold War, whereby whole populations
were tl1reatened by stale quarrels in ways not seen before, bound individuals to
the fates of their governments like never before.
Hence in the 1940s the twin concepts of 'national interest' and 'national
security' took centre stage in International .Relations and Security Studies. Waller
Lippmann, an American journalist who popularized the term 'Cold War' also defined
the nature of security that would characterize that era. 'A nation has security when
it does not have to sacrifice ils legitimate interests lo avoid war and is able, if
challenged, lo maintain them by war' (Lippmann 1943: 32). The USA's new preeminence and preparedness to act on the world stage in 1945 was an additional
key factor in promoting this approach. The government of the USA found itself in
a position of unprecedented dominance and compelled to utilize its powC'r in a way
that it had shown little inclinatjon to do in lhe past. Using the precursor 'national'
in a government's political rhetoric is always a device to convince society to rally
behind the government and garner legitimacy for a potentially controversial policy.
The US government was embarking on a radical new direction in its foreign policy
and needed its society united and on board for the journey (McSweeney 1999: 20--1).
US academic, and godfather of Realism in the 1940s and 1950s, Hans Morgenthau
summarized this new dynamic.
The nation state is to a higher degree than ever before the predominant source
of the individual's moral and legal valuations and the ultimate point of
reference for his secular loyalties. Consequently, its power among the other
nations and the preservation of its sovereignty are the individual's foremost
concerns in international affairs.
(Morgenthau 1972: 32)
The scale of the threat posed by nuclear war in the second half of the twentieth
century served to weld the security of individual people in the USA and elsewhere
to that of their governments. The state would assume the responsibility for
protecting its citizens and demand their loyalty in return in a strengthened version
of the 'Social Contract' relationship articulated by political philosophers such as
Hobbes and Locke from the seventeenth century. Hobbes's advocacy of the need
for the Leviathan (meaning a strong state) to save individuals from the dangerous
anarchy that would otherwise result from the pursuit of their own selfish interests
was a major influence on Morgenthau and the Realists. In the late twentieth century
the anarchy was the international state system and the dangers came, to a greater
extent than ever before, from other states.
Hence the Realist approach to International Relations r epresented a revival
of the understanding that the state was crucial to securing the lives of its citizens
in a different guise. In between Hobbes and Morgenthau, however, political
philosophy and state governance in Europe and North America was more influenced
by Liberalism and a very differ ent notion of security. Eighteenth-century Liberal
philosophers were alarmed that the social contract had become overbalanced and
that the Leviathan was endangering rather than protecting its individuals. Paine,
Montesquieu, Mill and Smith all referred to 'security' in their notable works and
Bentham saw security and liberty as synonymous declaring that, 'without security
equality could not last a clay' (Bentham 1876: 96).
McSweeney observes that security over time had come to be defined in
International Relations solely as an adjective rat.her than a noun or, as 'a commodity
rather than a relationship' (McSweeney 1999: 15). The human part of a human
condition had been lost and the term become synonymous with realpolitik, the
interest. o( the state. Military might and the application of the 'national interest' can
secure lives but it can also, of course, imperil them. Additionally, human lives can
be imperilled by a range of issues other than military ones (Table 1.3). A thorough
application of security in the study of global politics must, surely, recognize this
or else admit that it is a more limited f-i elcl of inquiry: 'War Studies' or 'Strategic
The meaning of 'security' is not just an arcane matter of academic semantics. The
term carries significant weight in 'real world' political affairs since threats to
the security of states have to be a priority for governments ~!J_Q threats to the lives
of peopfe are increasingly accepted as more important than other matters of
contention. The need to widen the meaning of security in global politics was
recognized by prominent statesmen long before it achieved a certain fashionability
following the end of the Cold War. In the late 1970s the Independent Commission
on International Development Issues (ICIDI), chaired by former West German
chancellor Willy Brandt and including the former premiers of the UK and Sweden,
Heath and Palme, concluded in their influential report that:
An important task of constructive international policy will have to consist in
[sic] providing a new, more comprehensive understanding of'security' which
would be less restricted to the purely military aspects . . ..
Our survival depends not only on military balance, but on global
cooperation to ensure a sustainable biological environment based on equitably
shared resources.
(ICIDI 1980: 124)
The Brandt Report helped raise the profile of poverty as an international issue (see
Chapter 4) but global security politics continued to be focused on military matters
in general, and the Cold War in particular, until the passing into history of that
conflict at the end of the 1980s. As with the academic b·eatment of security, however,
it is important to remember that the notion that the conduct of international security
politics should be about non-military as well as military issues was not born of the
1990 peace dividend. Rather, it first emerged in those two previous eras of Liberal
optimism which followed the twentieth century's other two global conflicts. Though
its chief historical legacy is a failure to keep the peace, tJ1e League of Nations first
implemented the idea that some lateral thinking was required to avert war by
incorporating within its system of organizations, alongside conflict resolution
mechanisms, 'specialized agencies' focusing on health and welfare. The Second
World War, which prompted the dissolution of the League, led the United Nations
to change the military approach to security of its predecessor, more in line with
Realist logic, but it still persisted with the lateral approach. The specialized agencies
were retained and the UN Charter openly declares as an aim: 'the creation of
conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful anrl friendly
relations among nations' (Article 55). In addition the Constitution of the World
Health Organization (WHO), the largest in the widened roster of specialized
agencies taken under the UN's wing, explicitly states that human well-being is a
precondition for world peace (see Chapter 7). The UN also went further than the

SECUR ITY AND SECUR ITI ZATION
I ,eague of Nations in for the first time giving international expression to the idea
of keeping the peace for individual people as well as states through the
1·nshrinement of human rights, thus moving towards a deepened understanding
of security.
In the 1990s the UN was able to revive and further develop this line of
Iii inking within the concept of human security.
The concept of security must change - from an exclusive stress on national
security to a much greater stress on people's security, from security through
armaments to security through human development, from territorial to food,
employment and environmental security.
(UNDP 1993)
I 'robably the first articulation of human security in international politics came two
y('ars earlier at a Pan-African conference co-sponsored by the UN and the
Organization for African Unity.
The concept of security goes beyond military considerations. [It] must be
construed in terms of the security of the individual citizen to live in peace
with access to basic necessities of life while fully participating in the affairs
of his/ her society in freedom and enjoying all fundamental human rights.
(African Leadership Forum 1991)
J'he UNDP line has been endorsed by other UN agencies, in the General Assembly
:ind by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The more 'Realist' element of the
I IN system, the Security Council, has been less radical but bas become a 'widener',
if not a 'deepener'. Jn 2000 the Security Council passed a resolution on a non1nilitary issue for the first lime when it debated the global HIV/ AIDS pandemic
(see Chapter 7).
Many states have come Lo take a widened approach to security since the 1990s.
J'he US Clinton administration made extensive use of academic advisers and a
hurgeoning literature on the 'national security' imperative of taking on board non111ilitary concerns now that the Soviet threat had receded. The impact of this was
made explicit in the 1994 'National Security Strategy', an annual foreign policy
manifesto. 'Not all security risks are military in nature. Transnational phenomena
such as terrorism, narcotics trafficking, environmental degradation, rapid population
growth and refugee flows also have security implications for both present and long
lerm Anlerican policy' (White House 1994: 1). Clinton's widening approach to
security owed much to his special adviser, Strobe Talbot, who, in turn, was inspired
by Joseph Nye's concept of 'soft power' (Nye 1990). Soft power for Nye denotes lhe
non-military dimension of state power, particularly rooted in tJ1e world of information.
For the US government being 'on top' of information on global issues was useful
not only for better comprehending problems like AIDS aml lra11::;nalional crime but
for advancing the USA's standing in the world. Explicit recognition tJiat the protection
of US citizens was a domestic as well as foreign policy matter came in the aftermath
of the September llth 2001 terrorist strikes on New York and Washington with the
launch of a new government department for 'Homeland Security'.

Fewer countries have taken the more radical step of deepening as well as
widening in embracing human security. The Canadian government like their
southern neighbour were influenced by Nye but have gone further and repeatedly
expressed their support for human security in their foreign policy statements.
Canada's Foreign Minister from 1996 to 2000, Lloyd Axworthy, advanced the
concept rhetorically in the UN General Assembly and other global forums and
practically, by being a leading advocate for the creation of the International Criminal
Court (ICC). Cynics have suggested that this strategy was just a tactical move by
the Canadian government to raise the diplomatic profile of a middle ranking power
in an exercise of populism (McDonald 2002: 282). Axworthy's advocacy of 'soft
power' gives some credence to this since Nye's concept ultimately is concerned
with the advancement of state interests rather than altruism or the global interest,
but the Canadian government has done much to further global political responses
for the common good. The Canadians, for example, have been at the forefront of
campaigns to ban the use of land mines and reform the UN Security Council so
that it is less constrained by power politics.
Perhaps most significantly for the advancement of deepened security, the
Canadian government signed a declaration with their Norwegian counterparts at
the 1998 Lys0en Conference launching the Human Security Network. This network
advocates the development of global policies focused on the human interest,
whether or not these happen to coincide with state interests. By 2012 the network
had expanded to include eleven other slates, both geographically and politically
diverse (Austria, Chile, Costa Rica, Greece, Republic of Ireland, Jordan, Mali,
Netherlands, Slovenia, Switzerland and Thailand).
Human security has become both a new measure of global security and a
new agenda for global action. Safety is the hallmark of freedom from fear,
while well-being is the target of freedom from want. Human security and
human development are thus two sides of the same coin, mutually reinforcing
and leading to a conducive environment for each other.
(Human Security Network 1999)
The securitizotion of issues
It is clear that designating an issue as a matter of security is not just a theoretical
question but carries 'real world' significance. The traditional, Realist)way of framing
security presupposes that military issues (and certain economic issues for Neorealists) are security issues amhlss uCihnust be prioritized by governments above
other 'low politics' issues, important though these might ~. - - As stated earlier, governments do tend to be somewhat Realist in their foreign
policies and this high-politics/low-politics distinction is evident in the level o( slate
expenditure typically allocated to the achievement of military ~ecu ly as opposed
to other issue areas. The government of South Africa trebled its allocation of the
state exchequer for fighting AIDS for 2002-3 to $1 billion from the previous financial
year. This was a significant response by the government to criticism that they had
not done enough to tackle this massive threat to life. However, the increased

SEC URITY AND SECURITIZATION
npenditure needs to be set in context. For the same :financial year the slice of the
budget set aside for military defence was $21 billion. However, there seems little
c lou bt that few South African citizens would consider the prospect of armed invasion
lrom Mozambique, Zimbabwe or any other state more of a threat to their lives than
AIDs.:i Around 5 million people in South Africa (11 per cent of the population) are
111fccted with HIV, and AIDS is the country's biggest killer, claiming an estimated
10 per cent of all deaths in 2002 (Dorrington, Bradshaw and Budlender 2002). In
rnmparison, South Africa has no obvious external military threat. Straight
comparisons between government expenditure on different areas are problematic
since different policy goals cost different amounts of money. Similarly, you could
posit that South Africa's lack of military adversaries is a measure of the success of
ils defence policy. Even if this were to be accepted, however, the threat of AIDS
rl'mains acute in South Africa and there is little doubt that more could be done to
alleviate the problem. The government of poorer Uganda, for instance, cut HIV
prevalence by half in the late 1990s through a concerted public information
rampaign (Ammann and Nogueira 2002).
South Africa is by no means unusual in such a disparity of priorities and,
indeed, has done more than most countries to shift priorities away from military
defence if you bear in mind that, in the early 1990s, it became the only state in
history to unilaterally disarm itself of nuclear weapons. Military threats are, of
rnurse, more apparent to some countries than others, and so global figures give
:i better insight into the balance between health and defence expenditure. The scale
of threats to the world as a whole are quantifiable and, as a result, the misprioritizing
of expenditure becomes obvious. World military expenditure accounts for 2.6 per
t't'nt of global GDP (SJPRI 2011), whilst world health expenditure makes up 8.2
pt'r cent of global GDP (WHO 2012a; 2012b). Over a third of the world's health
('xpenditure is private and so cannot be considered as government prioritizing of
h<'alth (except in so far as it is considered as an alternative t:o public health). Overall,
I hen, governments allocate about twice as much money to health as to military
s('curity. Consider this in relation to the re lative threat to people's lives posed by
military and health threats (fable 1.3).
In considering the figures in Table 1.3 a few qualifications need to be taken
into account. It is entirely natural to die of ill-health since we all die in the end and
'old age' or 'natural causes' make up a proportion of the deaths by 'disease'.
I Jowever, a third of all deaths are from communicable diseases which cannot be
thought of as inevitable and many of the people who die from non-communicable
diseases die 'prematurely' from diseases like cancer which are, at least partially,
avoidable. Additionally, 'disease' incorporates deaths from malnutrition which most
certainly are politically avoidable (see Chapter 4). Also, while some accidents may
be unavoidable and, to a certain extent, 'natural', this is, in fact, a pretty small
proportion even for 'natural disasters' (see Chapter 9).
It is an indication of how the study of security in International Relations has
become skewed over time that the issue most associated with the discipline is a
comparatively minor threat to most people in me world. Oratlo fU1e security threats
considered in this book the average "'citizen -of the world is least threatened by
military action from another state or a foreign non-state actor. l 'flreats are invariably
clo d familiar. This is exemplified by the fact that more people kill
themselves ea h y~-;u=- than are killed in both homicides and 'political killings'
combined. Suicide is not considered in this study since this is a voluntary death
but this is an area the WHO have recently increased research into since there are
clearly underlying reasons why people, in increased numbers, take their own lives.
Security 'wideners', including some Realists, accept that non-military issues
can become 'securitized' and hence be privileged with 'national security' status. The
issues securitized in this way, however, are arbitrarily defined. The tendency
has been, on the one hand, to select non-military issues which military forces can
help deal with, such as fighting drugs barons abroad or assisting in civil emergency
operations. On the other hand, 'securitizalion' has sometimes been granted to
external non-military problems on the basis that they have domestic military
repercussions. Issues such as AIDS or environmental degradation in distant countries
may de-stabilize regional balances of power and trigger military conflict which the
onlooking government may be drawn into or affected in some capacity. Hence, with
widening, the logic of national interest and prioritizing high politics is not really
challenged. It is more of a refinement of the way in which external threats are
calculated and a case of allowing 'low politics' to rise lo prominence in the absence
of major 'high politics' threats. Military defence is still being prioritized and security
is still being defined as a very specific noun rather than as an adjective.
The political practice of widening security has sometimes proved counter
to the interests of the people affected by the issue due to a clumsy militarization
of tasks previously performed by more appropriate personnel. Recent post-conflict
'nation-building' exercises in Afghanistan and Iraq have been notable for a
militarization of development projects, with remaining armed forces being
redeployed to reconstruction tasks and 'winni11g the hearts and minds' of the locals.
Such 'humanitarian' roles may have some beneficial results for local populations
but are, of course, ultimately driven by military expediency rather lhru1 human
security. 'foe disillusionment of pressure groups with this phenomenon was made
clear in 2004 when Medecins Sans Frontieres pulled out of Afghanistan with its
President Dr Rowan Gillies, declaring: 'we refuse to accept a vision of a future
where civilians trapped in the hell of war can only receive life-saving aid from the
armies that wage it' (Gillies 2004). One consequence of this phenomenon has been
a backlash against the concept of human security by development lheorists as
merely representing the militarization of development. Many academic applications
of the concept have, indeed, taken the approach that it is a 'merging of development
and [military) security' (Duffield 2001) but, for the concept to have real meaning,
it is important not to conflate it with 'widened security' and recognize that the human

SECUR IT Y AND SECUR ITIZATION
securitization of development puts the security of ilie vulnerable centre-stage, not
I he geopolitical interests of states.
The Copenhagen School approach takes a step forward from widening in
using ilie meiliodology of the 'speech act' to define when an issue becomes a
sc•curity issue. In iliis approach security issues can be military or non-military but
are distinguishable by the urgency that is attached to them in political discourse.
'If by means of an argument about the priority and urgency of an existential threat
I he securitizing actor has managed to break free of procedures or rules he or she
would otherwise be bound by, we are witnessing an act of securitization' (Buzan,
Waever and de Wilde 1998: 25). This methodology allows for a more behavioural
definition of security than 'conventional widening' since issues given priority by
people oilier than the government are included in the framework. However, this
approach still leaves the act of securing ilireatened people to the state. This can
result in life-threatening issues being excluded from consideration because the
government still chooses not to prioritize them or because the voices speaking for
securitization are insufficiently loud. Security ilireats particular to women, for
example, tend to be marginalized because of difficulties in 'being heard' amongst
the 'speakers of security' in society (see Chapter 5). Non-military issues are more
easily accommodated by the speech act approach but there is still a large measure
of subjectivity and relativism in leaving the demarcation to governments rather
than objective analysis.
Securi is subjective in that individual fears do not necessarily tally with the
reality of threats but individual needs are a better gui e to · e JSsuestliat inatTer
than the priorities of governments. The securi!:Y of governments does not equate
with the security of the people they are meant to represent:-f 1-iis has already been

Conclusions
If politics is about the 'authoritative allocation of values' (Easton 1965: 96) issues
arise over contention over certain values. In International Relations the traditional
assumption has been that the core value is the preservation of state sovereignty
and that this automatically commands pride of place at the top of the domestic and
international political agendas. However, it has become increasingly evident over
the years that values other than this are becoming prioritized and that the pursuit
of state security can often undermine human security. Political issues are myriad
but can ulitmately be distilled down to contention over the allocation of certain
cure values such as security, economic gain and altruism.
It is perfectly natural to give priority to security over the other values since
it is a precondition for realizing their allocation. If security is considered from the
perspective of individual people, however, issues are less easily compartmentalized.
Most issues of state altruism, such as the granting of emergency foreign aid, are
matters of life and death to the people affected. Many issues of state economic
gain, such as altering the terms of international trade, are security matters for people
in other states affected by the change. State altruism exists in the world, as do
some limitations to the pursuit of economic gain, but not to the san1e prominence
as in the domestic politics of states where individual people are empowered with
votes and/ or rights of citizenship. Individual security is recognized in democratic
states as overriding other values (at least most of the time) as is evidenced by
health and safety laws restricting business activities and 'social security' laws. In
global politics issues of life and death frequently are not treated as priorities because
they do not coincide with state gain or security. The blinkered pursuit of profit can
enrich some but imperil others. If saving others from abuse or disaster is seen
as an act of charity, rather than political duty, it will only happen infrequently and
selectively. Perceived threats (Table 1.1) and actual threats to people (Table 1.3)
are so far removed from the way in which issues are conventionally ordered on
the political agenda by states that International Relations theory and international
political practice needs to find ways of accommodating them, or cease to be
connected in any meaningful way with human behaviour and needs.
Human rights policies have developed significantly in recent decades but this
has not yet come close to securing all humans. Governments tend to prioritize the
rights and lesser interests of ilieir own citizens over ilie fundamental rights of others,
and human rights are still routinely treated as secondary to 'national security'
issues where the two are perceived to clash. The tightening up of migration laws
and the increased surveillance of foreign citizens in the present 'war against terror'
in the USA and Western Europe represent cases in point. The lives of far more
people in today's world, however, are imperilled by human rights abuses ilian by
terrorist and conventional military attacks. Throughout the total war era of the
twentieth century a case could be made that the security of individuals was
inextricably tied up with that of their states, but that era has now passed into history.
Today the issues that threaten people's lives bear such little relation to those issues
that dominate the international political agenda that statecentricism is impeding
both the study and the practice of that most fundamental of political concerns:

SECU RI TY AND SEC URITIZ AT I O N
securing people. The word security derives from the Latin sine cura, meaning
'without care'. As such it is a fairly elastic term since the 'cares' may be major fears
or minor frustrations. Complete freedom from care is both impractical and
undesirable. Human life that does not have any everyday concerns is unimaginable
and a complete absence of risk-taking in society would eliminate much beneficial
scientific progress and entertainment from life. As such this inquiry into security
in global politics focuses on the most meaningful fears there are: threats to the
lives of people. ----
